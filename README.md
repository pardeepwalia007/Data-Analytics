## Project Summary
  This project analyzes Washington State EV adoption from 2010–2025, focusing on adoption growth, affordability, range evolution, and regional distribution.
  The goal was to create an end-to-end pipeline: cleaning raw registration data in Python,
  building KPIs, and visualizing insights in Tableau.

	•	🚘 Top Manufacturers – Tesla dominates adoption, followed by Chevrolet and Nissan.
	•	💰 Affordability Segments – Most EVs fall into the $60k–80k MSRP bracket, but affordable options (<$40k) are emerging.
